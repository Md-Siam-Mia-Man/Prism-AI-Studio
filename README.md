## üíª Usage
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
**Start the Flask Server:**
```bash
python prism.py
```

**For one-click RUN**
    Create a new Prism-AI-Studio.bat Batch File on your Prism-AI-Studio directory using the script given below:

    @echo off

    :: Activate the conda environment for Prism-AI-Studio
    CALL "C:\ProgramData\<Your Anaconda distribution name>\Scripts\activate.bat" Prism-AI-Studio

    :: Navigate to the Prism-AI-Studio directory (Change path according to yours)
    cd /D path/to/your/Prism-AI-Studio
    
    :: Run the Prism-AI-Studio web interface script
    python prism.py

**Access the Web Interface:**  
üåê Open your browser and visit: [http://127.0.0.1:3005](http://127.0.0.1:3025)

## ‚ú® How to Use ‚ú®

Using Prism AI Studio is a breeze!

1.  **Access the App:** Open `http://127.0.0.1:3025` in your browser.
2.  **Upload Images:** Drag and drop your image files onto the designated area, or click it to browse your files. Accepted formats: PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, BMP, TIFF.
3.  **Configure Settings (Sidebar):**
    *   Choose your desired **Upscaling Model**.
    *   Select the **Upscale Factor** (e.g., 2x, 4x).
    *   Pick an **Output Format** (PNG recommended for quality).
    *   Toggle **Face Enhancement** (Prism-AI-Studio) On/Off (if available).
    *   Adjust **Advanced Settings** like Tile Size if needed (especially if you encounter memory errors).
    *   Select a UI **Theme** if you like! üåà
4.  **Model Downloads:** If you're using a model for the first time, the app will automatically download it. You'll see progress notifications! ‚òÅÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüíª
5.  **Enhance!** Once your images are uploaded and settings are configured, smash that **"Enhance Images"** button! ‚ú®
6.  **Watch the Progress:** See the status updates on the image thumbnails in real-time.
7.  **Download Results:** Once completed, download buttons will appear on the enhanced image thumbnails. You can also use the **"Download All"** button to get a ZIP file of all successful enhancements. üì¶

## üß† Models & Configuration üß†

*   **Real-ESRGAN Models:** The app supports several pre-defined models, downloaded automatically to the `./weights/` directory:
    *   `RealESRGAN_x4plus` (Default, good general-purpose 4x)
    *   `RealESRNet_x4plus` (Faster alternative to x4plus)
    *   `RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B` (Optimized for 4x Anime upscaling)
    *   `RealESRGAN_x2plus` (General-purpose 2x)
    *   `realesr-animevideov3` (For Anime Video frames, 4x)
    *   `realesr-general-x4v3` (General-purpose 4x with denoise option)

## üé® Frontend Themes üé®

Spice up your upscaling experience! Choose from several themes in the top-right dropdown:

1.  **Vibrant Glassmorphism (Default):** The sleek, modern look with purple/blue gradients.
2.  **Pastel Dream:** A softer, lighter theme with pastel orange/yellow tones.
3.  **Ocean Breeze:** Cool and refreshing deep blue to cyan gradients.
4.  **Sunset Glow:** Warm pink and orange hues for a cozy feel.

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting & Notes ‚ùó

*   **CUDA Out of Memory Errors:** If you see errors related to GPU memory during enhancement (especially with large images or high scale factors):
    *   Try reducing the **Tile Size** in the "Advanced Settings". Start with values like `256` or `128`. A value of `0` attempts to process the whole image at once.
    *   Try reducing the **Upscale Factor**.
*   **CPU Performance:** Processing on the CPU will be significantly slower than using a compatible NVIDIA GPU. Be patient!
*   **Model Downloads:** Initial model downloads require an active internet connection and can take some time depending on your network speed and the model size. Progress is shown via notifications.
*   **Single Worker Limitation:** Remember to run the server with only **one worker** (`--workers 1` if using Uvicorn directly) due to the use of shared in-memory state.
